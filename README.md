Working with machine learning algorithms to develop further understanding of AI and ML

* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* Tourism Based Chatbot built cities activities recommendations based on popularity and google reviews

# Chatbot 
* Chosen city can be input, the system will pull information from google maps, reviews, etc to plot the city and it's activities based on these. (TBD: Chosen type of activity reccommendation)
* GPT API has been test integrated for "Human" feel to bot reccomendations and responses
* Chatbot seems to no longer have access to geopandas for location input
* Will not work on public git as I do not want my Google API key to be public, can be easily downloaded and tested
